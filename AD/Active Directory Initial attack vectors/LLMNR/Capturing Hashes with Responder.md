### Command Usage
 `sudo responder -I eth0 -dwP`

### Command Breakdown

  The command `sudo responder -I eth0 -dwP` is used to run the Responder tool with specific options. Here's a breakdown of each option:

- `-I eth0`: Specifies the network interface (`eth0` in this case) on which Responder should listen for incoming traffic and perform its operations.
    
- `-d`: Enables the Responder daemon mode, which allows it to continuously listen for and respond to requests.
    
- `-w`: Enables the NTLMv2 capture and authentication feature, which allows Responder to capture NTLMv2 challenge/response hashes when clients attempt to authenticate.
    
- `-P`: Enables the HTTP and HTTPS capture and authentication feature, which allows Responder to capture credentials sent over HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
    

This command effectively starts Responder on the specified network interface, ready to capture and respond to certain types of network traffic, including NTLMv2 and HTTP/HTTPS traffic, which can be useful for performing various types of network attacks, such as credential harvesting and man-in-the-middle attacks.
