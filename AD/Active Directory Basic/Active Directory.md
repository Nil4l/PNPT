==IN a windows domain , credentials are stored in a centralized respository called Active Directory.==

==The server that is in charge of runnnig the AD services is called Domain COntroller.==

The core of any Windows Domain is the **Active Directory Domain Service (AD DS)**. This service acts as a catalogue that holds the information of all of the "objects" that exist on your network. Amongst the many objects supported by AD, we have users, groups, machines, printers, shares and many others. Let's look at some of them:

## Users
****
Users are one of the most common object types in Active Directory. Users are one of the objects known as **security principals**, meaning that they can be authenticated by the domain and can be assigned privileges over **resources** like files or printers. You could say that a security principal is an object that can act upon resources in the network.

Users can be used to represent two types of entities:

- **People:** users will generally represent persons in your organisation that need to access the network, like employees.
- **Services:** you can also define users to be used by services like IIS or MSSQL. Every single service requires a user to run, but service users are different from regular users as they will only have the privileges needed to run their specific service.

## Machines

**_Machines_**

Machines are another type of object within Active Directory; for every computer that joins the Active Directory domain, a machine object will be created. Machines are also considered "security principals" and are assigned an account just as any regular user. This account has somewhat limited rights within the domain itself.

The machine accounts themselves are local administrators on the assigned computer, they are generally not supposed to be accessed by anyone except the computer itself, but as with any other account, if you have the password, you can use it to log in.

**Note:** Machine Account passwords are automatically rotated out and are generally comprised of 120 random characters.

Identifying machine accounts is relatively easy. They follow a specific naming scheme. The machine account name is the computer's name followed by a dollar sign. For example, a machine named `DC01` will have a machine account called `DC01$`.

## Security Groups vs OUs

You are probably wondering why we have both groups and OUs. While both are used to classify users and computers, their purposes are entirely different:

- **OUs** are handy for **applying policies** to users and computers, which include specific configurations that pertain to sets of users depending on their particular role in the enterprise. Remember, a user can only be a member of a single OU at a time, as it wouldn't make sense to try to apply two different sets of policies to a single user.
- **Security Groups**, on the other hand, are used to **grant permissions over resources**. For example, you will use groups if you want to allow some users to access a shared folder or network printer. A user can be a part of many groups, which is needed to grant access to multiple resources.
