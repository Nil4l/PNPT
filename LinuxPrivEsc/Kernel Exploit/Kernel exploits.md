 our target vm is vulnerable to dirtycow exploit



After running the DirtyCow exploit successfully, the `/usr/bin/passwd` binary is modified to include a backdoor that allows you to gain root privileges without knowing the root password. This backdoor can be used to execute commands with root privileges, effectively giving you full control over the system.

In your specific case, the output of the exploit indicates that the `/usr/bin/passwd` binary was backed up to `/tmp/bak` before being modified. This is a common precaution to ensure that the original binary can be restored if needed.

Once the exploit is successful, you can use the modified `/usr/bin/passwd` binary to escalate your privileges to root and perform administrative tasks on the system. However, it's important to note that using exploits like DirtyCow without permission is illegal and unethical. Always ensure that you have authorization before attempting to exploit vulnerabilities in systems.
