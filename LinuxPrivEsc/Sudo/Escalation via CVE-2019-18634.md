you can add things to the `/etc/sudoers` file in order to give lower-privileged users extra permissions. For this exploit we're more interested in one of the other options available: specifically an option called `pwfeedback`. This option is purely aesthetic, and is usually turned off by default (with the exception of ElementaryOS and Linux Mint - although they will likely now also stop using it). If you have used Linux before then you might have noticed that passwords typed into the terminal usually don't show any output at all; `pwfeedback` makes it so that whenever you type a character, an asterisk is displayed on the screen. Inside the `/etc/sudoers` file it is specified like this:

Here's the catch. When this option is turned on, it's possible to perform a [buffer overflow](https://tryhackme.com/room/bof1) attack on the sudo command. To explain it really simply, when a program accepts input from a user it stores the data in a set size of storage space. A buffer overflow attack is when you enter so much data into the input that it spills out of this storage space and into the next "box," overwriting the data in it. As far as we're concerned, this means if we fill the password box of the sudo command up with a _lot_ of garbage, we can inject our own stuff in at the end. This could mean that we get a shell as root! This exploit works regardless of whether we have any sudo permissions to begin with, unlike in CVE-2019-14287 where we had to have a very specific set of permissions in the first place.

Here's a proof of concept:

In this command we're using the programming language Perl to generate a lot of information which we're then passing into the sudo command as a password using the pipe (`|`) operator. Notice that this doesn't actually give us root permissions -- instead it shows us an error message: `Segmentation fault`, which basically means that we've tried to access some memory that we weren't supposed to be able to access. This proves that a buffer overflow vulnerability exists: now we just need to exploit it!

The particular exploit that we're going to be using was written by Saleem Rashid ([@saleemrash1d](https://twitter.com/saleemrash1d))

This is a program written in C that exploits CVE-2019-18634. In reality BOF attacks are considerably more complicated than in the explanation above, so we're not going to go into a huge amount of detail about what the program is doing exactly, but you can imagine that it's doing the same thing as in the explanation: filling the password field with rubbish information, then overwriting something more important that's in the next "box" with code that gives us a root shell.

I've already uploaded a compiled copy of the code into the VM, so all you need to do is run it. This next section is interesting (and useful if you ever need to use this program for a CTF or other hacking challenge), but not essential for completing the room. This is the process that you would use if you were to download and compile the program for yourself:
