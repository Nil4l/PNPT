Shared object injection, also known as shared library injection or dynamic library injection, is a technique used to inject and execute malicious code into a running process by manipulating the process's use of shared libraries. This technique is commonly used in malware, exploits, and privilege escalation attacks. Here's how it works:

1. **Shared Libraries**: Shared libraries are files containing code and data that can be used by multiple programs. They are loaded into memory when a program is executed and provide functions and resources that the program needs to run.
    
2. **Dynamic Linking**: Most operating systems use dynamic linking to load shared libraries into memory at runtime, instead of statically linking them at compile time. This allows multiple programs to share the same library, reducing memory usage and improving efficiency.
    
3. **Injection Process**: Shared object injection typically involves the following steps:
    
    - Identifying a target process: The attacker identifies a target process that is vulnerable to shared object injection.
    - Preparing a malicious shared object: The attacker creates a shared object file (.so file) containing the malicious code.
    - Injecting the shared object: The attacker uses a method to inject the malicious shared object into the target process's memory space. This could be achieved through vulnerabilities in the target process, such as buffer overflows, or by manipulating the environment variables or configuration of the target process to load the malicious shared object.
    - Executing the malicious code: Once the shared object is injected into the target process, the malicious code is executed within the context of the process, potentially allowing the attacker to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or perform other malicious actions.
4. **Detection and Prevention**: Detecting and preventing shared object injection attacks can be challenging. Security measures such as using secure coding practices, regularly updating software to patch vulnerabilities, and using security tools to monitor for suspicious behavior can help mitigate the risk of shared object injection attacks.
    

It's important to note that shared object injection is a sophisticated attack technique that should only be used for legitimate security research or testing purposes with appropriate authorization.
