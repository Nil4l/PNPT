A sock puppet, in the context of online interactions, refers to a fake or secondary account created and used by a person to deceive others. The term comes from the idea of using a puppet to hide one's true identity.

Sock puppets are often used for various purposes, including:

1. **Manipulating Discussions**: Sock puppets may be used to manipulate discussions, skew opinions, or create the appearance of support or opposition for a particular viewpoint.
    
2. **Artificially Inflating Popularity**: Sock puppets may be used to artificially inflate the popularity of a person, product, or idea by creating multiple accounts to like, share, or comment on content.
    
3. **Harassment or Trolling**: Sock puppets can be used for harassing or trolling behavior, where the user creates multiple accounts to target and harass specific individuals or groups.
    
4. **Evasion of Restrictions**: Sock puppets may be used to evade restrictions or bans imposed on a user's main account.
    

Many online platforms have policies against the use of sock puppets and may take action against users who engage in such behavior.
